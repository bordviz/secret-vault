## About project

Secret Vault is a simple analog of HashiCorp Valut that performs the functions of storing secrets and providing access to them to other users. There are 4 endpoints implemented in this project:
- Create a new Secret Vault (admin side)
- Create an access token to access the vault (administrator side)
- Retrieving data from the vault (administrator side)
- Retrieving data from the vault (user side)

## Customization
If you want to make changes to the startup configuration, you can modify the config file located in config/config.yaml, or you can create your own config file. If you add your own config file, change the CONFIG_PATH field in the .env file.

### Config file
```yaml
env: local # Application startup mode, depending on the selection, will differ the level and appearance of logs
migrations_path: ./migrations # Path to the folder where migrations to the database are located (it is not desirable to change it)

database: # Database connection
  host: localhost # Database host
  port: 5432 # Database port
  user: postgres # Database user
  password: postgres-user # Database password
  name: vault # Name of database sever
  sslmode: disable # Database SSL mode
  attemps: 5 # Number of attempts to connect to the database 
  delay: 5s # Interval between attempts to connect to the database
  timeout: 5s # Abort after a failed attempt to connect to the database

http-server: # HTTP Server configuration
  port: 8200 # HTTP Server port
  timeout: 5s # Read and Write timeout
  idle_timeout: 60s # Wait time to receive a repeat request from a user with an open connection 
```

### .env file

- CONFIG_PATH - Path to the config file
- ROOT_TOKEN - Administrator token for creating storages and creating new access rights 
- SECRET - The secret to creating custom tokens

## Installation
- [Local Installation](#local-installation)

To start a project using Docker, run the following command from the root of the project:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
To stop, use:
```bash
docker-compose down
